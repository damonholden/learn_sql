# SQL Lesson 11: Queries with aggregates (Pt. 2)

To filter individual rows generated by a `GROUP BY` clause, the `HAVING` clause achieves this:

```SQL
SELECT column, AGG_FUN(column_expression) AS aggregate_result_alias, ...
FROM my_table
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING group_condition;
```

The `HAVING` clause constraint is written the same way as a `WHERE` clause, but the application is on grouped rows as opposed to the entire table.
