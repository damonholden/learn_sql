# Capitalised keywords

SQL does not require keywords to be capitalised. This is convention as it helps readers distinguish SQL keywords from column and table names. It basically makes the query easier to read.

`SELECT name, age, height FROM people WHERE age =25` is more readable than `select name, age, height from people where age =25`.
