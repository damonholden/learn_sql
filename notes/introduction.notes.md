# Introduction notes

## What is SQL

- SQL (Structured Query Language) is designed to query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.
- Due to SQL's simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.
- There are many SQL database systems including SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. All support the common SQL language standard, but implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports.

## Relational Databases

- A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables.
- Each table in a SQL database is similar to an excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of rows of data.
- An example of relational database table could be a table of all vehicles that people in the world are driving. This table might store the model, type, number of wheels, and number of doors of each vehicle. A database like this might also contain additional related tables containing information like a list of all car manufactures, every recall instance against a car, or even sales for each car.
- SQL can be used to answer specific questions about data.
